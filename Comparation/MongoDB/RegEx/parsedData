Offered $100,000 to bring in bail jumper Jon Mardukas, it's not long before bounty hunter Jack Walsh has got his hands on his man. But what Walsh doesn't realise is that the Mob and the FBI are also on Mardukas' trail. Great chemistry between co-stars Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin help set this smart and funny odd couple comedy miles above its peers.

Offered $100,000 to bring in bail jumper Jon Mardukas, it's not long before bounty hunter Jack Walsh has got his hands on his man. But what Walsh doesn't realise is that the Mob and the FBI are also on Mardukas' trail. Great chemistry between co-stars Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin help set this smart and funny odd couple comedy miles above its peers.
