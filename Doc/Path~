Prelimilary Understanding
	1.different and popular types of database
	2.commonly used terms and concepts
	3.review the principles in database management course 
	4.review how to deal with some common thorny problems in dbms project



1.Import the xml file into database by self parsing is not hard. But is there any interface which can tranform the xml to a popular format.
2.More details about the requirment and performance parameter are needed. Because there are some distinct options can be set to configure the database which could lead different database performance.



1.	Document - MongoDB
	Key-Value, simplest efficient
	Wide-Column	


structured and unstructured data
Distributed Computing:horizontal scale and vertical scale
How is the Key-Value DB used



SQL vs NoSQL
	unstructured data
	scalibility horizontal scaling
	what about the speed? it depends
	what about the light weighted 
	what about limited hardware resource?
		depends on different type of NoSQL db type
	A report benchmark says that given a simple but large dataset, mysql performs much better the mongodb in search time


What's the key features to choose a DB.
	schemaless or schema?
	scaling in size
	resources needed
	performance


How to compare the performance between DBs?
	If I use the actual XML data, then the performance greatly depends on data model you choose or other options 
	If don't use the actual XML data, how to represent the characters of actual data 
	How to mimic the limited hardware resources
